**RecruitTrack is a desktop application for simplifying candidating tracking.** It organizes applicant information, communication history, and hiring stages for quick access in a CLI (Command Line Interface), and a accompanying GUI (Graphical User Interface).

* If you are interested in using RecruitTrack, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing RecruitTrack, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
