# RecruitTrack User Guide

RecruitTrack is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all applicants.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com j/Front-end Engineer s/Online Assessment a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a applicant named `John Doe` to the Applicant Records.

   * `delete id/3` : Deletes the 3rd applicant shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all applicants.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the applicant will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.

Format: `search [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [j/JOB_POSITION] [s/STATUS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Only applicants that match all provided criteria are returned (i.e. `AND` search).<br>
  e.g. `search n/John e/john@example.com` searches by name and email

* The `IDENTIFIER_TYPE` can be one of the following:
    * `n/` – Name
    * `e/` – Email
    * `p/` – Phone number
    * `id/` – The ID in the last shown list
* The `CONTACT_IDENTIFIER` must match the corresponding identifier type (e.g., a name for `n/`, an email for `e/`, etc.).
* The `--force` flag (optional) bypasses confirmation prompts and deletes the applicant immediately.

Examples:
* `delete n/John Doe` deletes the applicant with the name "John Doe".
* `delete e/johndoe@example.com` deletes the applicant with the email "johndoe@example.com".
* `delete id/3 --force` deletes the 3rd applicant in the last shown list without confirmation.

* The `IDENTIFIER_TYPE` can be one of the following:
    * `n/` – Name
    * `e/` – Email
    * `p/` – Phone number
    * `id/` – The index of the applicant in the last shown list

Format: `summary [n/NAME] [e/EMAIL] [j/JOB_POSITION] [s/STATUS]`

* Having no identifiers will summarize all applicants
* The filter is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` will match `Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Only applicants that match all provided identifiers are returned (i.e. `AND` search).<br>
  e.g. `summary s/Rejected a/Bishan` summarizes applicants with the status "Rejected" and the address "Bishan".

Examples:
* `summary` sorts all the applicants
* `summary j/Software Engineer` returns
```commandline
Summarized 22 / 45 Applicants

```


### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
